Here I have 2 versions of more or less the same program. The program generates particles and interraction forces between them to produce interesting visualizations.

The Python program can handle roughly 40 particles in real time, while the C++ can handle roughly 400. 

Currently the C++ has a bug/feature that leads to the particles gravitating towards the upper left corner, I suspect this is due to rounding errors. Nevertheless, the results are beautiful.
